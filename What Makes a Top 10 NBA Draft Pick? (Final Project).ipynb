    "# What Makes a Top 10 NBA Draft Pick?\n",

    "## Project Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Every June, the National Basketball Association (NBA) holds a draft, where each of the thirty teams have an oppurtunity to select two top prospects to join their organization. With only two rounds in the draft - and only two chances per team - it is crucial that a team does proper research, scouting, and analysis to ensure that their draft picks have a significant impact on their odds at winning a championship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the NBA data API for all players currently in the league, we will examine top 10 draft picks and see how they compare to all players in the league. Then we will make use of various individual player attributes to determine what properties correlate to top NBA draft picks. After having read through our data analysis, we hope that you will understand the importance of research and scouting that NBA teams undergo in selecting top draft picks.\n",

    "We can also look at the top 10 draft picks dataset by strictly size. This includes height and weight. If we look at the chart below we can see there is an obvious middle ground between 220 - 250 pounds. There is obviously a less of cluster as you get further away from this range. From this information, we also see there are few players that lie below 200 pounds. This contradicts our data from sorting top 10 draft picks by position. The 'Guard' position, historically, are the lowest weight players in the NBA, averaging around 190 pounds. However, as seen above, the 'Guard' position is the highest occuring position.|"

    "Another attribute to graph by is place of origin. Many NBA rookies, and eventually NBA stars, are drafted from major college basketball programs. The more money college basketball programs have, the more NBA prodigy's they can churn out. The results below are very expected. It is logical that the colleges which have historic basketball programs, which tend to have the most success each year as well as are perennial championship contenders, and which recruit the top prospects out of high school, are represented the most significantly in the Top 10 NBA Draft Pick data. Schools like Kentucky, Duke, Arizona, Indiana, Syracuse, and UNC are not only among the winningest college basketball teams, they also attract the most talented high school prospects. This results in the school also sending a fair amount of their most-talented players to the NBA. For example, the University of Kentucky is famous for their one-and-done basketball legacy. This means top recruited basketball players out of high school to the University of Kentucky only spend a year playing NCAA basketball, then get recruited in the top of their NBA class. This has been very frowned upon in the recent years due to schools seeming to focus more on what makes them money, sports, then academics, expecially for those who are recruited and stay in the college system for only one year. They lack any sort of education if their NBA career fails. However, the schools at the top of the list below are famous for winning seasons and winning the National Championship for college basketball. As an NBA team, why wouldn't you want to recruit from the teams who consistently win National Championships and produce the best basketball players?"

As seen in the \"P > |t|\" column below, only two of the values are close to the critical value of 5% (p-value of 0.05), 0.002 and 0.083, for weight and position, respectively. We can partially reject the null hypothesis, because it is clear that some player attributes contribute to the overall draft pick. Our R-squared value, 0.807 is fair, as it shows that we did not overfit the model. We will be able to figure out more regarding our R-squared value in the next step with training and testing."

Variables, training_X and training_y are used to generate, or train, the regression model. Then, the testing_X data is used with the model in order to make predictions for the predicted overall draft picks. Then, the predictions are compared to the actual draft picks in testing_y. We decided to split up training and testing data in a 75%/25% split, in favor of training. A majority of the dataset should be used for training the model, but since our dataset is not significantly large, we decided on 75% over 80%, 90%, or higher. We will display the first 15 results of the predicted draft picks."

    "From our models, it is clearly difficult to correlate player attributes to the overall draft pick. This only adds to the difficulty that Coaches, General Managers, Owners of NBA franchises face when the NBA Draft season comes around each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only attribute that truly seemed to correlate with a higher draft pick was the weight of the player. It seems as though more research must be done in order to determine which player attributes matter most in regard to drafting a top 10 pick. It is surprising that other attributes such as height, colleges, or place of origin did not correlate more with the data. These attributes where among the strongest when analyzing different parts of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other attributes that can be added or subtracted from this dataset. We did not touch any gameplay statistics from players. This could be the logical next step to creating an accurate model. One, the dataset would be much larger, since there are many, many gameplay statistics kept on each player. Two, we might be able to find that those attributes, meaning high gameplay statistics, would correlate better with players who were top 10 NBA draft picks and players who were not top 10 NBA draft picks."

    "We now have a couple conclusions from our models. One, we can see that these attributes, while they seem strong on the surface, do not correlate closely to why a player is a top 10 draft pick. Two, these results give us a next step to look at other player attributes such as gameplay statistics from a top 10 draft pick before they were drafted, or looking at their performance in the league after they were drafted. These could give insight into what makes a top 10 NBA draft pick, while also making the sample size larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the results where weak in terms of correlation, this does bring up a few good points. For example, there stereotypes like 'because a player played for University of Kentucky they will be a top 10 draft pick'. However, we can see that they almost do not correlate at all. From these results we can see that many aspects of the data can be improved and added upon to make a more accurate model and truly find 'What Makes a Top 10 NBA Draft Pick?'."
